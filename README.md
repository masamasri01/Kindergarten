As parents, we want the best for our kids. In today's climate, teacher to parent communication is more vital than ever. From naps and snacks, to magic moments or what happened when they tripped over in the garden and bumped their knee, parents have to always be a part of their child’s journey. As parents nowadays spend more time away from their kids, they  need to be comfortable with a software that keeps them connected with their kids.

At our website, we have developed an interactive kindergarten management software that combines and simplifies administrative tasks. Recording children’s learning and development is as easy as ABC, and parent communication with staff is easy, effective and instant.

Sending secure messages to parents or staff ,sharing children’s daily activities, meals, naps and more with families, giving permissions for staff, and the ability of Updating the information improves communication.
